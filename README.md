## ðŸ§© Reflection Journal

### 1. Client and Software Summary
The client, **The Gaming Room**, wanted to expand its existing Android game *Draw It or Lose It* into a multi-platform application. The software needed to handle multiple game sessions, manage users and teams, and ensure that only one instance of a game existed at a time. The new design also needed to improve scalability and performance while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

---

### 2. What I Did Well
I did particularly well in **analyzing the system requirements** and translating them into a clear and structured design. I applied the **Singleton pattern** effectively to enforce a single game instance and created a well-organized design document that clearly outlined each componentâ€™s purpose and relationship.

---

### 3. Helpful Process Insight
Working through the design documentation before any coding helped me plan ahead and visualize how different components would interact. This process improved my ability to anticipate potential design challenges and strengthened my understanding of how software architecture supports functionality.

---

### 4. Area for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the **evaluation section** by including more detailed comparisons between different operating platforms, focusing on cost efficiency, deployment ease, and long-term scalability. This would make the design document more comprehensive and useful for future development planning.

---

### 5. Understanding and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the userâ€™s needs by focusing on **usability, scalability, and accessibility**. My goal was to ensure that players could enjoy a smooth experience regardless of their platform. Considering user needs is essential because the end-user experience determines whether software truly meets its purpose and provides value to both the client and the users.

---

### 6. Design Approach and Future Strategies
My approach used **modular, object-oriented design principles** supported by UML diagrams and best practices in documentation. In the future, I plan to use **Agile design iterations** and continuous stakeholder feedback to refine requirements more dynamically. I would also integrate **DevOps tools** to streamline deployment and testing for multi-platform environments.
